        <p>
          Customer reviews on vendor profiles aid other users in making informed choices. In order to maintain openness:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vendors shall not falsify reviews or create fake testimonials from friends, family, or colleagues;
          </li>
          <li>Vendors may challenge the review and seek verification by emailing <a
              href="info@celebrationspaces.com">info@celebrationspaces.com</a>, but only if the review is documented as
            untrue or malicious;
          </li>
          <li>The vendor has 7 days from the time of request to present satisfactory evidence to dispute a review;
          </li>
          <li>If proven, the review will be removed within one week from the date of review and confirmation; </li>
          <li>Celebration Spaces cannot verify every review but reserves the right to investigate all reviews that are
            flagged.
          </li>
          <li>Vendors are strongly advised to issue responses to negative reviews in a constructive and respectful
            manner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Note: Authentic feedback, whether positive or negative, is a hallmark of trustworthiness.
          Some of the most trusted vendors on Celebration Spaces have received contested reviews.

        <h3>Policy on Creation and Deletion of Profile
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A celebration Vendor profile is created by default but cannot be deleted upon request. It can, however, be
            made unclaimed or unsearchable at the discretion of Celebration Spaces.
          </li>
          <li>Profiles for Vendors may be generated without approval in cases such as reviews left by customers for
            Vendors who are not yet registered. In such instances, the profile is considered “Unverified” until the
            Vendor completes the necessary steps to claim and finalise it.
          </li>
          <li>Celebration Spaces maintains the right to remove the review and profile history in order to protect the
            integrity of its platform.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Promotions on Other Platforms

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>From time to time, Celebration Spaces may have partnerships with other platforms like Nykaa, Amazon, or
            Paytm and provide these partner discounts and product access to Vendors listed on Celebration Spaces.
          </li>
          <li>Vendors accept that any products or services procured from third-party platforms via Celebration Spaces
            partnerships are subject to the vendor’s respective terms and conditions.
          </li>
          <li>Any purchasing shall be done strictly to improve the services offered to customers and shall not be for
            resale or personal gain.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!--  -->
